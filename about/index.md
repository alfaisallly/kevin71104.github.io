## My Interest:

## My Younger Life:

During high school, I was engrossed at designing algorithms (in a more mathematical fashion). 
The intricacy of algorithms is fascinating, so I have devoted my first two years (almost completely) in designing and writing C/C++ codes on online judge system (ended up writing more than thousands of codes). 
And I have wrote many detailed solutions to problems I found interesting in [Blogspot.com](http://momo-funnycodes.blogspot.tw){:target="_blank"} (mostly in Chinese).
