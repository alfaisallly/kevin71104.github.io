I am Kai-Chieh Hsu (許凱傑), or you can just call me Kevin. 
I'm an undergraduate majoring in electrical engineering at National Taiwan University (NTU).
Currently, I am the research assistant of <a href="http://access.ee.ntu.edu.tw/" style="color: rgb(0,51,204)">Prof. An-Yeu (Andy) Wu</a>
and conduct the research in **ECG signal telemonitoring**.
At the same time, I am working with <a href="http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jfkiang/" style="color: rgb(0,51,204)">Prof. Jean-Fu Kiang</a> on 
**direction-of-arrival (DOA)** estimation.

## My Interests:
Due to the population ageing, the health care on chronic diseases requires attention.
Applying signal or imaging processing on biomedical data, such as 1D signals (ECG and EEG) and 2D/3D signals (MRI/CT), really attracts me. 
With the advent of **machine learning**, I believe there can be a huge improvement in the medical cyber-physical systems, and thus I enjoy conducting research in this field.
Currently, I am among two relative projects:
- On-demand recovery of ECG signals (apply classification on compressed ECG signals and only reconstruct ECG signals classified as atrial fibrillation) and the chip implementation of this algorithm
(Working with <a href="http://access.ee.ntu.edu.tw/" style="color: rgb(0,51,204)">Prof. An-Yeu (Andy) Wu</a>)
- MRI Meningioma Segmentation (Working with <a href="https://www.ntuh.gov.tw/en/surg/doctors/DR/XiaoFuren.aspx" style="color: rgb(0,51,204)">MD. Furen Xiao</a>)

In addition, I am interested in simulating the real world. 
By formulating the signal model, I can apply different signal processing techniques on received signals to estimate concerned parameters.
I enjoy the progress of improving algorithms and the sense of accomplishment when I manage to estimate the concerned parameters.
My current research is in:
- Elevation angle estimation of targets near sea surface under cluttering (Working with <a href="http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jfkiang/" style="color: rgb(0,51,204)">Prof. Jean-Fu Kiang</a>)
