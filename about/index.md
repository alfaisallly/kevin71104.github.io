I am Kai-Chieh (Kevin) Hsu, an undergraduate majoring in electrical engineering at National Taiwan University (NTU).
Currently, I am the research assistant of <a href="http://access.ee.ntu.edu.tw/" style="color: rgb(0,51,204)">Prof. An-Yeu (Andy) Wu</a>, 
conducting the research in **ECG signal telemonitoring**.
At the same time, I am working with <a href="http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jfkiang/" style="color: rgb(0,51,204)">Prof. Jean-Fu Kiang</a> on 
**direction-of-arrival (DOA)** estimation.

## My Interests:
As the worldwide population ages, the healthcare on chronic diseases requires more attention.
I'm especially fascinated by the application of **signal or imaging processing** on biomedical data, including 1D signals (ECG and EEG) and 2D/3D signals (MRI and CT).
With the rise of machine learning, I believe there can be a huge technical improvement in medical cyber-physical systems, and I am devoted to pursuing further studies in this field.
Currently, I am working on two relative projects:
- On-demand recovery of ECG signals (apply classification on compressed ECG signals and only reconstruct ECG signals classified as atrial fibrillation) and the chip implementation of this algorithm
(Working with <a href="http://access.ee.ntu.edu.tw/" style="color: rgb(0,51,204)">Prof. An-Yeu (Andy) Wu</a>)
- MRI Meningioma Segmentation (Working with <a href="https://www.ntuh.gov.tw/en/surg/doctors/DR/XiaoFuren.aspx" style="color: rgb(0,51,204)">MD. Furen Xiao</a>)

In addition, I am interested in simulating the real world. 
By **formulating the signal model**, I can apply different signal processing techniques on received signals to estimate concerned parameters.
I enjoy the progress of improving algorithms and the sense of accomplishment when I manage to estimate the concerned parameters.
My current research is in:
- Elevation angle estimation of targets near sea surface under cluttering (Working with <a href="http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jfkiang/" style="color: rgb(0,51,204)">Prof. Jean-Fu Kiang</a>)
