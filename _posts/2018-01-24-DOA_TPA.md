When we use antenna array to estimate the **direction-of-arrival (DOA)** of received signals,
we want to attain as many **degree-of-freedoms (DOFs)** as possible.
With a well-arranged antenna array and corresponding signal processing algorithm, 
the number of sources we can detect is more than the number of used antennas.
In this work, we proposed a **triply-primed array (TPA)**, which consists of three uniform linear arrays (ULAs), 
with \\(N_1\\), \\(N_2\\) and \\(N_3\\) sensors, respectively; where \\(N_1\\), \\(N_2\\) and \\(N_3\\) are mutually primed integers.
The spacings in the first, second and third ULAs are \\(N_2N_3d\\), \\(N_1N_3d\\) and \\(N_1N_2d\\), respectively, and \\(d\\) is the unit spacing.
Since entries of the covariance matrix had the phase delay proportional to the difference of spacings, 
by obtaining the fourth order difference covariance matrix,
the origin holes in the physical array or the virtual array based on second-order difference were complemented.
To completely take the advantage of the proposed TPA, we utilized **compressed sensing (CS)** approach to estimate the DOAs 
due to the fact that received signals had sparsity in the angular domain.

The contribution of this work comes in two aspects:
- Our proposed TPA can operate with \\(O(N_1N_2N_3)\\) DOFs to estimate the DOAs of multiple incident quasi-stationary signals
- The number of consecutive and unique delays in the fourth order difference covariance matrix is expressed in closed form
